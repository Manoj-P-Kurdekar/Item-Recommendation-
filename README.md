# Item Recommendation App

This GitHub repository contains code for an Item Recommendation App built using Python and Streamlit. This app allows users to enter a Customer ID and a date, and it provides recommendations for items that the specified customer might be interested in purchasing on that date. The recommendations are generated using collaborative filtering with the Surprise library.
